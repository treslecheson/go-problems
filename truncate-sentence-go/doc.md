# Truncate Sentence (Go)

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You want to truncate `s` such that
it only contains the first `k` words. Write a function called `truncate_string`
that accepts `s` and `k` and returns `s` after truncating it.

Ex:
```go
s1 = "Hello how are you Student"
k1 = 4
truncate_string(s1, k1) # -> "Hello how are you"

s2 = "What is the solution to this problem"
k1 = 5
truncate_string(s2, k2) # -> "What is the solution to"

s3 = "Don't panic"
k3 = 7
truncate_string(s3, k3) # -> "Don't panic"
```
