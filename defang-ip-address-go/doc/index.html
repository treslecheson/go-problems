    <h1>Defang an IP Address</h1>

    <p>
      Write a function called <code>convertAddress</code> that takes in an IP
      address as a string and validates and returns a defanged IP address also
      as a string. If it isn&#39;t a valid address, then return an empty string.
    </p>

    <p>
      A defanged IP address is formatted to separate the parts of an address so
      that software doesn&#39;t convert it into a link, such as in
      documentation. The method to use in this problem is to replace all
      <code>.</code> with <code>[.]</code>. A valid IP address is one where
      every octet (the 3 digits between each period) is within 0 - 255,
      inclusive.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-go">convertAddress(&#34;192.168.1.9&#34;) // -&gt; &#34;192[.]168[.]1[.]9&#34;
convertAddress(&#34;172.3.265.42&#34;) // -&gt; &#34;&#34;
</code></pre>
