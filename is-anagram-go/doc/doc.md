# Is Anagram

Write a function called `isAnagram` that accepts two strings
and returns whether or not the second string is an anagram of
the first. (Hint: a dictionary could be a good way to track
the letters and number of letters in each string.)

```python
is_anagram("Sled", "LEDs") # -> True
is_anagram("read", "dear") # -> True
is_anagram("deer", "deere") # -> False
```
